# How a class of a regression/classification algorithm should look like:

- name of each document that is pushed to the git repo should include the functionality, e.g. "class_<used_algorithm>_<author>_revision"
- data is preprocessed and split in a previous called object - data input into reg./clas. object should be columnwise
- individual settings of each method have to be declared clearly (comments with all possibilites in the part of the code where the object is called)


# Topics to be further discussed

- class object that handles error and gives message to the user (user)
	boolean if error or not (try and except)
	affected parts (user input or 
	with get and set methods
