## Version 1.0

# Regression: 

1. We get input from user (excel sheet) - cleaned and preprocessed by other groups  (dataset, X and y already done)
2. We display the options available for regression. 
	1. If "alpha" is required, we get that input from user 
3. We display scores for each of these options against each other. 
4. After user selects one algorithm - we run the code according to that - and display "rms error", "tuned rms error". (predicted y value?)


# Classification

1. We get input from user (excel sheet) - data is split into X and Y by other groups  (dataset, X and y already done)
2. We display the options available for classification. 
3. We display scores based on the percentage of correct classification. And display predicted vs Actual.  
4. After user selects one algorithm - we run the code according to that - and display "score", "actual vs predicted".


## Discussion topics:
### Do we have to display results for all algorithms and compare ?
### What are the results user want to see ? 
### Dependent parameters for each algorithm (e.g. alpha) to be selected by user or given by us ?


For Christian : 

1. model names - 
	1. Regression: 
		1. Linear , Lasso , Ridge , K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree
	2. Classifiers: 
		1. Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours, State Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest. 
		
2. intercept - Should we display?
3. co-efficient - Should we display?
6. line plot/ scatter plot (predicted value and actual value ) - Should we display?
